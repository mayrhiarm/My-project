                    <p>Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. The learning was fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program. <br>

                        Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.

                <h3>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h3>
                <p>There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions. <br>
                    The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.
                </p>
